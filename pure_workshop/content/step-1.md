The **good news is that all the fields are clickable** and do not require copying and pasting. This will create great success.

Just a workshop to play with RKE2, Rancher, and Portworx. We will deploy everything in our own vms. We will deploy PX-CSI. However without an array it won't work. But you will understand the building blocks.

####
Deploying:
* **RKE2** - Kubernetes
* **Rancher** - Multi Cluster Manager
* **Longhorn** - Stateful Storage
* **PortWorx** - Better Stateful Storage

####
We are building:
* 3 VMS :
  * **server** ( Rocky 9.4 ) - Control Plane/etcd/Worker
  * **worker1** ( Rocky 9.4 ) - Worker
  * **worker2** ( Rocky 9.4 ) - Worker

Have FUN! Ask Questions!
